# 🏍️ Halo Ride – Augmented Reality Smart Helmet Companion App

**Halo Ride** is a cutting-edge Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) project that introduces an **AR-powered smart helmet** designed to address the everyday challenges of motorcycle riders — especially **delivery drivers**, **commuters**, and **recreational bikers** in urban environments like **Dubai**, yet would like to further expand it to a wider range of environments.

This repository contains the **mobile application prototype** and design documentation that supports the smart helmet system, enabling users to interact with features such as:
- AR navigation control
- Music and podcast streaming
- Hazard alert notifications
- Ventilation monitoring
- Ride analytics and summaries

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Traditional helmets lack the smart capabilities needed to reduce accident risk and improve rider comfort. Halo Ride fills this gap by integrating:
- 🧠 **Heads-Up AR Navigation**
- 💨 **360° Smart Ventilation**
- 🦻 **Bone Conduction Audio**
- ⚠️ **Real-Time Hazard Alerts**
- 🔋 **Dual Power System (Solar + LiFePO4 Battery)**

All designed to reduce distractions, maximize comfort, and ensure safer, hands-free riding for long durations.

## 📊 User Research & Design Process

We conducted **surveys, interviews, and competitor analysis** targeting:
- Delivery drivers (Careem, Talabat, etc.)
- University students
- Recreational riders

Key insights:
- 80% found mobile navigation distracting while riding
- 75% experienced severe heat discomfort
- Riders demanded **affordable**, **lightweight**, and **long-battery** helmet solutions

## 🔧 Prototyping Process

We created 3 working prototypes based on user testing feedback:

| Version | Highlights |
|--------|------------|
| Prototype 1 | Initial sketch with AR visor, fan system, and audio module |
| Prototype 2 | Improved airflow, repositioned components, modular battery |
| **Prototype 3** | Solar-powered helmet with smart battery, 360 ventilation, final UI |

Final prototype feedback was overwhelmingly positive — especially for **ergonomics**, **visual clarity**, and **comfort** during extended use.

## 👥 Personas & Scenarios

Our helmet was designed for 3 distinct user personas:

| Rider     | Needs |
|-----------|-------|
|Business commuter | Hands-free GPS, music, and comfort in heat |
|Delivery driver | Safer navigation, hazard alerts, 5-star delivery rating |
|University student | Safer rides post-accident, scenic route suggestions |
